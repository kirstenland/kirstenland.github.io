            <p>
                Hi! I'm Kirsty and I am making this website to practice web development.
                It won't look very nice or work very well but don't let that bother you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't like pictures of me, so you won't see any of those here.
                Instead, have this picture of Benjy, my cat, and Zippy, a toy turtle.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="resources/benjy.jpg" alt="My cat, Ben, lying on top of some books on a desk"/>
                <img src="resources/zippy.jpg" alt="An image of a toy turtle named zippy. He is green with large eyes."/>
